# CS435 - Cryptography 

A Python repository containing implementations of various classical and modern ciphers learned in my CS435 Cryptography class. Each cipher includes both encoding and decoding functions.

## Ciphers Included

- **Caesar Cipher** (`caesar.py`) - A substitution cipher that shifts each letter by a fixed number of positions

## Usage


## Future Additions

Additional ciphers to be implemented:
- Vigenère Cipher
- Affine Cipher
